Revision history for Perl extension Net::Ping::External.

In future Net::Ping::External may require perl 5.6.

newer versions of Net::Ping::External.

0.11: Feb 11 2003
- Fixed a problem that caused incorrect results in a lot of (and perhaps 
  all?) versions of Windows.  
- Also fixed the _ping_bsd function to actually call ping and return a 
  value (oops).
- Peter N. Lewis submitted a _ping_darwin function that will hopefully 
  work on all versions of Mac OS X.
- Changed the test suite to only implore people to send me test results 
  if there were any failures.
- Test suite can now run non-interactively, as it doesn't prompt the 
  user to hit enter.

- Fixed unrecognized characters in _ping_freebsd that caused the
  module to die on some systems. (Thanks to Jonathan Stowe for the
  patch.)

0.05: Apr 20 2001
